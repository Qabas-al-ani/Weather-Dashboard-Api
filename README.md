## Technologies:

- HTML, I used the html to write the structure of my web page.
- Bootstrap and CSS, I used the Bootstrap and CSS to style my web page and give it some nice looking by adding colors.
- JavaScript to add the functionality to the Weather Dashboard.
- OpenWeatherMap Api to get the Weather data.

## Editors:

- [Microsoft VS CODE:](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) it’s an awesome code editor.
- [Nodepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) it’s very helpful code editor that am using all the time plus it’s very light weight.
